# Understanding Encoding in Machine Learning

This repository provides code examples for various encoding techniques commonly used in machine learning, particularly for handling categorical variables.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide practical examples and clear explanations of different encoding methods, enabling me to understand and implement encoding effectively in my machine learning workflows. 

It addresses common challenges related to categorical data and aims to clarify:

* Why encoding is necessary for machine learning algorithms.
* The differences between various encoding techniques (e.g., One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding, Ordinal Encoding).
* The advantages and disadvantages of each method.
* When to use specific encoding techniques.
* How to implement these techniques using Python libraries like scikit-learn and category_encoders.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/PrajwalaMugajjiShambulingappa/Understanding_Encoding.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/PrajwalaMugajjiShambulingappa/Understanding_Encoding.git)
    cd Understanding_Encoding
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
    ```
3.  **Explore the code examples:**
    * Review the Python scripts in the repository.
    * Run the scripts to observe the encoding processes.
    * Modify the scripts to experiment with different datasets and encoding parameters.

## Usage Examples

Here are some example use cases for the code in this repository:

* Preprocessing categorical features for linear regression, logistic regression, and decision tree models.
* Handling nominal and ordinal categorical data.
* Dealing with high-cardinality categorical features.
* Comparing the performance of different encoding methods.
* Preparing data for use in various machine learning algorithms.
